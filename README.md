This repo contains code that reads in refugee data from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-08-22/population.csv (see https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-08-22/readme.md for more info), filters it for only data in the year 2022, and writes that to the CSV file `refugee_2022.csv`.
